# Business Problem

A modern e-commerce company wants to improve revenue growth,
conversion rates, and marketing efficiency.

Key challenges:
- Understanding where users drop off in the funnel
- Identifying which marketing channels and campaigns drive real revenue
- Measuring the impact of A/B experiments
- Identifying high-value customer segments and product categories

The goal of this project is to use SQL analytics to transform
raw event and transaction data into actionable business insights.
